Dear readers,

This script is used to make a "Google Sheet" link to another sheet.
Allows the targeted sheet to be updated when the source receives changes.

How do we set the script up?

First go over to your form and press the "3-dot" button on the top right center.
Now open the script editor in the source orbat (Target is possible as well) and copy past the script in the editor. 

The following changes have to be made:
The target and source key is the section between " ": https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/"1223456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw"/edit?pli=1&gid=389711642#gid=389711642
The sheets name has to be idetical to the names of the chosen sheets.

When ready, go to triggers and set up a trigger that starts after a change is made in the source.

To test it out, make sure that there is already an answer in the form.
